# DevContainer Environment - Philomina Ekezie
### March 14, 2024 

In this document, I will discuss the configuration of the DevContainer I will be using for my Flutter application development.
I would like to make a quick disclaimer: at this moment in time, I do not have a fully working and functioning DevContainer environment due to a few issues that I have not been able to overcome throughout the development of my project. I am currently working on resolving these issues as quickly as possible. For the purposes of this assignment, I will be speaking in the future tense about my DevContainer which will soon be fully functional and complete.

## Introduction - DevContainer
A DevContainer, short for development container, is a Docker container that is specifically designed to create development environments for software products. DevContainers have numerous qualities and features that make them extremely beneficial to the software developer and have cause them to become increasingly popular.
A significant feature of DevContainers is their ability to ensure a consistent development environment. DevContainers allow users to isolate dependencies and tools within them, which can later be accessed through an IDE of the users choice. DevContainers are extremely beneficial in the context of Flutter application development for the following reasons:
- The code in DevContainers will run the same way on any computer no matter what operating system the computer uses. This allows users to not have to worry about compatibility constraints that usually surface due to using different environments.
- DevContainers are extremely portable. Users can move their dev containers from one computer to computer and enjoy the comfort of working on their project on multiple computers.

## Configuration of the DevContainer
To configure my DevContainer, the following steps will be taken:
1) Setting up a base image. I will use a Docker image to set-up my Flutter environment. The purpose of the Docker image is to build, deploy, run, update, and manage my DevContainer.


## Usage
As I mentioned prior, my devContainer is not fully functional at the moment. However, once I have it properly working, I will update this section with proper instructions for starting my container, editing the code, running my Flutter application, and any other relevant workflows.

## Challenges and Solutions
- One major challenge I experienced as I have been working on this project occurred during my initial download of Docker. Because of certain settings on my computer, the installation of the platform was unsuccessful. Figuring out why my laptop was not allowing the platform to be downloaded was of much importance, because this was an essential first step into actually making progress on the project. To solve this problem, I searched through my computer's settings to remove or turn off anything that was blocking the download;.
- Another challenge I experienced was understanding all of the new concepts that are included in this project. To overcome this, I spend quality time learning and familiarizing myself with these concepts and slowly understanding how they all relate.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, DevContainers are an extremely reliable, portable, and efficient way to develop environments that can be used to create software products.
