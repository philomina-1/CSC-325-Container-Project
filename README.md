# CSC 325 CI/CD Pipeline Project
### Author: Philomina Ekezie
Hello! Welcome to my repository for my CSC 325 CI/CD Pipeline Project. In this class, we are focusing on building a CI/CD Pipeline to build a Flutter Web Application.

### CSC 325: Application Development & Deployment
Here is a brief excerpt from the course syllabus that describes the nature of the class:

"This course introduces the principles and practices of industry-standard software development tools with a
special focus on continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). This course will guide students
through the use of an integrated development environment (IDE), collaboration systems, CI/CD pipelines, and
automated testing tools. Emphasis will be placed on understanding how these practices facilitate a more efficient
and reliable software development process."
