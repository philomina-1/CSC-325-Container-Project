#### Structure

### Repository Setup
#### Structure

- `/.devcontainer`: Contains the recommended development environment configuration files. This ensures that all team members use a consistent environment, which reduces the "it works on my machine" problem.

- `/docs`: This directory hosts all project documentation, ensuring that design documents, setup instructions, and other important information are easily accessible and well-organized.

- `/app`: Houses the Flutter application source code. This separation ensures that the application code remains isolated from documentation and other non-app-related files, facilitating a clearer workflow and easier navigation.

- `/.github/workflows`: Contains the automated GitHub Actions definition files. These files define our continuous integration and delivery pipeline, automating tests, builds, and deployments based on predefined events and conditions.

- `git add .`: Stages all changes for commit.
- `git commit -m "Commit message"`: Commits the staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git push origin <branch-name>`: Pushes the commits to the remote repository.
- `git merge <branch-name>`: Merges the specified branch into the current branch.
