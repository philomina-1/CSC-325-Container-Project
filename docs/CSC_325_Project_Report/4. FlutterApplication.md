### What is Flutter?
Flutter is Google's open-source technology for creating mobile, desktop, and web apps with a single codebase. 

Here are some ways that Flutter stands out as a cross-platform development framework:

- **Close-to-native performance.** Flutter uses the programming language Dart and compiles into machine code. Host devices understand this code, which ensures a fast and effective performance.

- **Fast, consistent, and customizable rendering.** Instead of relying on platform-specific rendering tools, Flutter uses Googleâ€™s open-source Skia graphic library to render UI. This provides users with consistent visuals no matter what platform they use to access an application. 

- **Developer-friendly tools.** Google built Flutter with an emphasis on ease-of-use. With tools like hot reload, developers can preview what code changes will look like without losing state. Other tools like the widget inspector make it easy to visualize and solve issues with UI layouts.
