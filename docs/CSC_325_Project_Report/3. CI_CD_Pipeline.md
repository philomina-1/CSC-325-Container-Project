### What is a CI/CD Pipeline?
A pipeline is a process that drives software development through a path of building, testing, and deploying code, also known as CI/CD. By automating the process, the objective is to minimize human error and maintain a consistent process for how software is released.
Tools that are included in the pipeline could include compiling code, unit tests, code analysis, security, and binaries creation. For containerized environments, this pipeline would also include packaging the code into a container image to be deployed across a hybrid cloud.

### CI/CD Pipeline Setup
The meat of the CI/CD Pipeline is found within the `.github/workflows` directory. The `main.yml` file found within this directory contains the actions that automate the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment processes.

In terms of continuous integration, the file achieves the following:
:heavy_check_mark: Clone Repository: The `   ` line checks out the code in the repository so that it can be 
:heavy_check_mark: Dependency Verification:
:heavy_check_mark: Test Execution: Run any available Flutter tests present in the repository.

:heavy_check_mark: Build the Flutter Application: Build the Flutter web application using the appropriate commands.

In terms of Continuous Deployment, the file achieves the following:

:heavy_check_mark: Set up a workflow that deploys your built Flutter web app to GitHub PagesLinks to an external site..
:heavy_check_mark: Configure the necessary settings to publish your app at a specific URL 



### Utilized cloud services and local environments
The following cloud services and local environments were utilized by this CI/CD Pipeline.

### GitHub Actions
For this project, we utilized GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment processes of the Flutter application. GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows developers to automate their  build, test, and deployment pipeline. 

GitHub Actions was utilized to take advantage of the many benefits it provides, including the following:
- Integrates seamlessly with other GitHub features, such as pull requests and issues.
- GitHUb Actions makes it extremely easy to manage entire workflows in one place.
- Can be used to create workflows that automatically build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

For more information on the purpose and significance of GitHub Actions, please visit this website: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions.
You can also view their documentation here: https://docs.github.com/en/actions.

### Relation to Project: Workflows
A GitHub workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.

Within this project, GitHub Actions was used to create workflow files that contained the necessary actions to accomplish the following:
1. Cloning the student's source code repository.
2. Dependency Verification.
3. Test Execution:
4. Run any available Flutter testspresent in the repository.
5. Report the test results.
6. Build the Flutter Application.
7. Ensure that the build process completes successfully.


These workflow files are stored in the `.\github\workflows` folder in the project repository. They include the following:
- `build.yml` - include detailed description here.
- `deploy.yml` - include detailed description here.

### GitHub Pages
For the deploy portion of our project, a reliable, real environment was needed to deploy to and host the flutter web application. GitHub Pages was chosen as the application's deployment environment. GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

GitHub Pages provides many benefits, like the following:
- Publishes any static file that is pushed to the repository.
- Supports thw creation of  static files build a site.
- Supports the customization of the build process locally or on another server.
  

### Configuration
