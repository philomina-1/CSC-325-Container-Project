# :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: Section IV: CI/CD Pipeline

### What is a CI/CD Pipeline?
A pipeline is a process that drives software development through a path of building, testing, and deploying code, also known as CI/CD. By automating the process, the objective is to minimize human error and maintain a consistent process for how software is released.
Tools that are included in the pipeline could include compiling code, unit tests, code analysis, security, and binaries creation. For containerized environments, this pipeline would also include packaging the code into a container image to be deployed across a hybrid cloud.

### CI/CD Pipeline Setup
Tools that are usually included in a CI/CD pipeline could include compiling code, unit tests, code analysis, security, and binaries creation.
For this CI/CD pipeline, the tyools were included in the setup:

1. Build Stage
2. Test Stage
3. Deploy Stage

### Utilized cloud services and local environments
The following cloud services and local environments were utilized by this CI/CD Pipeline.
