# CSC 325 Appliation Development and Deployment Final Project Report: Building a CI/CD Pipeline for a Flutter Application
### Philomina Ekezie

## :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: Introduction: Overview of CI/CD Pipelines and their significance in modern software development.
### What is a CI/CD Pipeline?
- In the world of Software Engineering, CI/CD refers to the practices known as Continous Integration and Continuous Delivery.
- CI/CD pipelines are pipelines that, after receiving an initial set of code, conduct tests on the code through sourcing, building, and staging phases. After these phases are complete, the pipeline releases the code as ready for production.
- CI/CD pipelines are significant in software development as they focus on improving software delivery throughout the software development life cycle by automating certain tasks.

### Significance of the CI/CD Pipeline for this Project
- The main focus of this course was to build a CI/Cd pipeline that would be capable of automating the Flutter application's build, test, and deployment processes.

## :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: DevContainer Environment: Details of the Docker container configuration used for Flutter development.
### What is the Dev Container?
A DevContainer, short for Development Container, is a Docker container that is specifically designed to create development environments for software products.

### Favorable Qualities of the Dev Container
DevContainers have numerous qualities and features that make them extremely beneficial to the software developer and have caused them to become increasingly popular. 

- DevContainers have the ability to ensure a consistent development environment.
- DevContainers allow users to isolate dependencies and tools within them, which can later be accessed through any IDE of the user's choice.


### Dev Container for Flutter Application Development
DevContainers are extremely beneficial in the context of Flutter application development for the following reasons:

- The code in DevContainers will run the same way on any computer no matter what operating system the computer uses. This allows users to not have to worry about compatibility constraints that usually surface due to using different environments.
- DevContainers are extremely portable.
- Users can move their dev containers from one computer to computer and enjoy the comfort of working on their project on multiple computers.
- By using the environment, all developers are sure that they are working with the same settings. 

## :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: Source Code Version Control Tools: Description of the version control system utilized (e.g., Git), focusing on how the source code is managed and integrated with the CI/CD pipeline.
1. **Git: Version Control System**

For this project, the chosen version control system is Git, which is a DevOps tool that is used for source code management. Git is the chosen VCS due to its ability to ensure easy collaboration and provide distributed development. The following are features of Git that make it a desirable resource for this project:

✔️ Every developer has an entire copy of the code on their local system

✔️ All changes to the source code can be tracked by others

✔️ Git provides regular communication between the developers

These are just a few of the benefits that Git provides. For more information on Git and its features, you can visit this website: https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/git-tutorial/what-is-git

Additionally, Github is used to maintain the source code for the project. GitHub is a Git repository hosting service that provides a web-based graphical interface. The following are features of Git that make it a desirable resource for this project:

- Easy Project Management
- Increased Safety With Packages
- Effective Team Management
- Improved Code Writing
- Increased Code Safety

These are a just a few of the many benefits of Github. For more information on GitHub, view this website: https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/git-tutorial/what-is-github


2. **Integration of Code with the CI/CD Pipeline**

The folders found within my GitHub repository include the relevant files that create the Flutter app and complete the build, test, and deploy stages.
The ' 'app' ` folder:
- The app folder contains the code that build the flutter app template.

The `./github/workflows' folder:
- In the ./github/workflows folder, the files `build.yml` and `deploy.yml` can be found. These files contain the actions that build the Flutter app and deploy it.
